# ClimateSchedulePrototype
Schedule climate prototype.

We will allow the user to quickly copy their regular presets to their scheduled presets.
This is a one way copy, so changes made after copying a preset to the scheduled preset won't affect the originial preset.

Below is a video demo of the app:
